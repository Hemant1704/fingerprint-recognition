# Fingerprint recognition

Fingerprint recognition is probably the most mature biometric technique, which finds lots of real - life applications since long ago. This project explores fingerprint recognition from two points of view: identification and authentication. 

The implementation is entierly done in Python and the main flow of the project is assembled in a Jupyter notebook fingerprint-recognition.ipynb.
